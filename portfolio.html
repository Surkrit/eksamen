        <h2> COVER PAGES </h2>
        <p>When it comes to film production, its important to have a sense of how every cog in the mechanism works. Branding your production with posters and magazine posts is what spreads the word of your film. This cover is my take on what the popular British film magazine “Empire” creates to promote upcoming films. The cover is created in inDesign with promotional photos from Empires website and a replicated version of their font, color choices and general minimalistic layout for their subscriber covers.</p>

      <h2> STOP MOTION </h2>
        <p>Since I picked up my very first camera, one of the primary ways to express myself is through the medium of stop-motion video. What sets it apart from other formats, is the ability to seamlessly create movies with a variety of different tools and not necessarily be limited to live action. This short film showcases what happens when a group of creative thinking people get together, throw their most obscure ideas together all the while working with a selection of household appliances.</p>

      <h2> ANIMATION </h2>
      <p>Animation is like a toybox for filmmakers. It provides this wonderful selection tools to play around with and allows the creator to work with it as far as the imagination can reach. With the benefits of software like Adobe Animate and Photoshop, it gives the creator the ability to really stretch those creative muscles. With this first animation, a painting called “A Demonstration in Psychic Summoning” by Mark Rogers, the assets taken out of the painting in Photoshop have been stitched together in Adobe Animate in order to create a more lighthearted take on what is otherwise a complex painting. </p>

      <h2> HTML ANIMATION </h2>
    <p>The second animation sort of a different kind, in that while it’s illustrated by me, the animation is made entirely in HTML. It shows a Newton Cradle swinging back and forth, escalating and fading the amount of balls swinging, in a rainbow palette. By drawing the cradle swinging back and forth in Adobe Illustrator on a long canvas and limiting the just one 300x300px canvas, creating a modern take on an old style of animation </p><br>

      <h2> 360 DEGREE VIDEO </h2>
        <p>With the consumption of visual media always expanding, one of the newest interesting formats is 360-degree video. As an installation project for Fredericia Voldene, our group decided to bring forth the world of AR through a 360-degree video prototype. The video is shot on a 360-degree camera and edited in Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro. With some authentic photos, provided by Fredericia Museum, the photos are inserted into the video, to create an illusion of AR and at the same time showcasing video editing abilities.</p>
